## Inspiration
I based this project off of a group project which was done with React that I had in college. This program was 
created using C# and Winforms in Visual Studios 2019, and T-SQL using SSMS. The main reason I started this project 
was so I can practice and gain more experience with C# and SQL. Also to practice using the debugger and refactoring my code.
